## Introduccion
The objective of this website is to showcase all movies made by japanese animation studio "Studio Ghibli"
Each card showcases the title and year of the movie, followed by a poster of the movie and a short synopsis of the plot.
## Languages
For this project I used **HTML** for the basic skeleton of the webpage, **CSS** for the formating of each card and **JavaScript** to complete the structure of the code in the backend
## Objective
The objective of this point is showcasing my capacity to fetch an external API via javascript and utilizing its data to fill the necessary information into each card
I also used a function to assign a poster to each card during its iteration in the APi
